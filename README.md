UniqueInt: Data Structures and Algorithms Assignment
Description
UniqueInt is a project developed as a solution for an assignment in the Enterprise Web Development course. The assignment tasks students with implementing a program that reads a list of integers from an input file, removes duplicates, sorts them, and writes the unique integers to an output file. Notably, the implementation must be done without utilizing standard libraries such as arrays, lists, or sorting functions.
